Product Sum
Write a function that takes in a "special" array and returns its product sum.

A "special" array is a non-empty array that contains either ints or other "special arrays"
The product sum of a "special" array is the sum of its elements, where "special"
arrays inside it are summed themseolves and then multiplied by their level of depth

depth = how nested it is 
[] = depth of 1
[[[]]] = depth of 3 

sample input 
array = [5,2,[7,-1],3,[6,[-13,8].4]]

sample output = 12
