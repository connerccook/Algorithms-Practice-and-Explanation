Validate Subsequence

Given two non-empty arrays of integers, write a function that determines whether the secod array is a subsequence of the first one

Pretty much a subsequence is when a list has only the values of the first array. Like a subset of it.

Sample input:
array = [5,1,22,25,6,-1,8,10]
sequence = [1,6,-1,10]

sample output 
true
